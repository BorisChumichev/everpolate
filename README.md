#### Synopsis

*Everpolate* provides a set of common interpolation algorithms implementations. Implementations given for interpolation are also implementations for extrapolation. Since it's written in JavaScript, *everpolate* could be used for web browser, Node.js and so forth. *Everpolate* is currently under development, so it's not published to any package registry. If you want to contribute feel free to contact me or you can create an issue.

#### Features:

* Step Function Interpolation
* Linear Interpolation
* Polynomial Interpolation
