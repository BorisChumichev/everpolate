#### Synopsis

*Everpolate* provides a set of common interpolation algorithms implementations. Implementations given for interpolation are also implementations for extrapolation. Since it's written in JavaScript, *everpolate* could be used for web browser or Node.js applications. 

#### Features:

* Polynomial Interpolation

#### Not implemented yet:

* Linear Interpolation
* Rational Function Interpolation 
* Cubic Spline Interpolation
* Multidimensional Interpolation
* Neural Network-based Interpolation

## Documatation
##### Polynomial Interpolation
